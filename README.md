# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection System

A deep learning–based web application that detects plant diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
The trained model is deployed using Flask and provides real-time predictions with confidence scores through a clean, professional web interface.

## 🚀 Features
- CNN-based plant disease classification
- Trained on PlantVillage dataset
- Supports unseen / random internet images
- Real-time prediction with confidence percentage
- Image preview before prediction
- Clean and responsive Flask UI
- Professional background and modern UI design

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Flask (Backend)
- HTML, CSS (Frontend)
- NumPy, OpenCV (Image Processing)

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User uploads a leaf image through the web interface.
2. The image is preprocessed (resized, normalized) and passed to the trained CNN model.
3. The model predicts the plant disease class.
4. The predicted disease name along with confidence score is displayed on the UI.


## 📊 Dataset
